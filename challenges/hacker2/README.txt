Your client is happy with what you have produced but now they want deeper analysis.  
It’s great you can do an average, I can do that in excel.  
I can also copy and paste columns too.  

So tell me something I don’t know…

Machine Learning Hint
Machine Learning is the name for the type of techniques that use algorithms to essentially learn from data. 
There are two types of learning: supervised and unsupervised. 
	Supervised is where you give the algorithm training data and the answers from which it learns. 
For example, classifying email as "inbox" or "spam" is where a machine learning algorithm is given examples 
of both kinds of email message, and then asked to check each incoming message, and sort appropriately.

Conversely, 
	Unsupervised machine learning is where the algorithm is given data and is asked to learn natural relationships or patterns 
that exist in the data. For example, given an overhead shot of a carnival you can assign each person a point in 2-dimensional space. 
Now, you don't know who is with whom, so giving training data is impossible, but you could cluster the points (people) into groups that are likely to be together.

If you can’t resist the urge to program something….

Download the Git repository and F5 (run) the  frequ_tut.py  file.


Getting errors?  A Pythonic way to do this would be to use “Pip”
If you don’t have pip, go to the site-packages directory and call 
--->	“easy_install setuptools”
--->	“easy_install pip”
--->	pip install <some awesome package>

**if you use Linux/Unix…..  sudo pip install <package>
