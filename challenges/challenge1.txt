Gents,

You get a dataset from a Client with a quick turnaround (of course) which needs data counted, summed and divided into two different spreadsheets.  The problem is that everything is currently in one spreadsheet and its almost 6,000 rows long so….did I mention it was on Friday at 3pm and you have to work the weekend in excel?  If only there was better way.

 
Use the attached and complete the following:


OBJs

1. Read in data to Python from a .CSV file (import csv àhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html )

2. Sort and Identify data

3. Sum the cost columns

4. Separate BRAC and ACTIVE data

5. Print out completed data to TWO separate .CSV files

 
Level 1

Bring the data into Python

Print all the data

Identify Unique Installations

Identify Unique Installation/Site combinations
 

Level 2

The current “Total” is not really an overall Total.  Sum the costs for Each individual Installation/Site Combination

Find the Average Cost per Site

Add the Average Cost to the data set à very important to client

Write the Answer to a .CSV

 
Level3 (Should you dare)


Split the Active data from the BRAC data and print two separate reports to .CSV
